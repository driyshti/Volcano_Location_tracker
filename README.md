# Volcano_Location_tracker
For the task of data visualization on a map using Python, I will be using a volcanoes dataset that is downloaded from Kaggle.
And to visualize the data on a map, I have used the Folium library in Python which is one of the best libraries in Python 
that we can use for the task of visualizing data on a map.

So this is how we can visualize geospatial data on a map using the Python programming language. 
To analyze geospatial data, we just need to plot the latitude and longitude data on a map by using the Folium library in Python.
